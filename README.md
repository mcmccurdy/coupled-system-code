Assorted code from JFM paper "Predicting convection configurations in coupled fluid-porous systems" by McCurdy, Moore, Wang.

(*) fig2c.tex: .tex from paper **with data**. "(c) Marginal stability curves while varying dˆ from dˆ = .15 to dˆ = .22 by increments of 0.05 with the respective critical Rayleigh numbers Ram∗ shown in red. As dˆ crosses the critical depth ratio of dˆ∗ = .181 for this parameter regime, the most unstable wavenumber jumps from am ≈ 2.1 to am ≈ 14.5. This signifies a sudden transition from deep to shallow convection (at the onset of convection) as dˆ increases from dˆ < dˆ∗ → dˆ > dˆ∗."

(*) fig3.tex: .tex from paper **with data**. "Critical depth ratios for various εT (ratio of thermal diffusivities) values, εT = 0.5,0.7,1.0. The solid lines represent the predicted dˆ∗ values from our theory (3.5), and the circles are the dˆ∗ values calculated from the marginal stability curves determined by McCurdy et al. (2019)."

(*) fig6.tex: .text file from paper **with data**. "Energy and Nusselt profiles and their respective derivatives for the three flow configurations shown in figures 4 and 5. Fixed parameters: Da = 1.0 × 10−4, Prm = .7, εT =.7, α=1.0, ∆t=2.5×10−4."

(*) lincase.m: calculating marginal stability curves, as done in fig. 2c of the paper. 

(*) process_margStab.m: to process the marginal stability curves, as done in fig. 2c of the paper. 

(*) small_Da_asymptotics.xlsx: critical depth ratios and other data from tables in paper.
